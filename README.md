# Weather_Prediction
We used Weather Data from NOAA to cluster the areas in US mainland with similar weather  which could be used in multiple scenarios

The Main problems that we tried to deal with, by clustering the weather data are -

What crop can an individual grow in the particular area by the level of precipitation? Where can a peron move from abroad based on weather

Scenario – an individual is: 
  Moving to the United States from another country
  Has the freedom to move to any location in the mainland
  High desire to move a location with similar weather to where they are moving from

What locations on the mainland of the United States have similar weather to where this individual is from?
